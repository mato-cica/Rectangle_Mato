<h1>Rectangle_Mato v1.0.0</h1>

" alt="v1.0.0 structure" style="float:right;">
is a small C++ console program which creates a rectangle builded of '+' sign.<br/>
After starting user should enter dimensions and coordinates of upper left angle of rectangle. That means four pieces<br/> 
of data: lengths, width, coordinates x and y. All of them are validated, so you can't enter anything but number without<br/>
decimal part (integer). If you try you'll get warning message and chanse to try again.<br/>
The length of rectangle is limited to fit in console window, and the width (height) also, just to fit in the screen <br/>
(no need to scroll to see complete object). <br/>
Once when length is entered the program calculates x coordinate so the rectangle stay in console window. The y <br/>
coordinate is limited just to avoid the scrolling. There is no way to enter a wrong dimension or coordinate - you'll<br/>
always be warned and get opportunity to try again until you enter correct data. <br/>
<h2>Structure of program</h2>
Templated class 'EnterDimension.h' is base of chain of inheriting. Templated class 'EnterPosition.h' is derived from<br/>
base. The class 'ShowRectangle.h' is derived from 'EnterPosition.h' class, as shown in figure 'v1.0.0 structure'.<br/>
Templated classe 'Mato_valid.h' has validating function. The class is called by 'EnterDimension.h' and <br/>
'EnterPosition.h'. <br/>
All the classes are defined in header files because .cpp files don't work with templated and inherited classes when<br/>
using GNU GCC compiler (g++).
